/*
Real-world Use Case Oriented
If you were embedding this logic into something larger, like testing, games, or simulations:

DecisionSimulator

Implies you're randomly making a yes/no, true/false choice â€” great for games, behavior modeling, or testing logic.

RandomTruthEvaluator

Emphasizes the boolean condition aspect â€” might be used to simulate truthiness.

CoinFlipSimulator

Because 0/1 â†’ Heads/Tails â†’ True/False is a very common metaphor in games and simulations.

ðŸ”¹ Abstract / Framework-style
If you were building this as part of a larger framework:

BooleanEngine

RandBoolUtil

BoolStreamGen

ðŸ§  Pro Tip:
Name it based on the context you're using it in.
If it's a standalone utility â†’ RandomBooleanGenerator
If it's part of a game â†’ CoinFlipSimulator
If it's a logic tester â†’ DecisionSimulator
